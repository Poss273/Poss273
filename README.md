- 👋 Hi, I’m @Poss273. I'm a father of three, and recently completed serving in the US Navy for the past decade.
  I work as an electrical/nuclear engineer, and want to make a career change.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming and becoming a software developer. This has been my dream for a while,
  and I am finally attending a university in pursuit of a degree in computer science.
  
- I have a passion for problem solving, learning, and logical/mathematical thinking. Programming is everything I ever
  wanted to do, but I didn't know it until later in life.
  
- 🌱 I’m finally back at school gaining a formal education in computer science, on track to graduate in around 2 years.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that can help me gain experience. So far I have only worked alone, but I would
  love to work with others to learn together.

- 📫 Please feel free to reach me at jposs87@gmail.com.
